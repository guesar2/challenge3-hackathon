Centralized simulation parameters. Previously these were magic numbers
scattered through the notebook (H_INIT at module scope, dt/rate_ref/steps
hardcoded inside __main__, etc.). Collecting them here makes it obvious
what to change to explore different system sizes, sweep rates, or
evolution times.
